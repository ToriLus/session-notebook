This is my note. This is a very helpful note about branches. 

#Branches heading


We can use branches for making sure we don't work on the main program and destroy everything. 
<p>Useful stuff contains:</p>
<p>Git branch commands</p>
- git switch -c <branchname> - create a new branch and switch to it
- git switch <btanchname> - switch branches
- git branch - list all your branches
- git branch -a - list ALL branches (local and remote) 
- git branch -d <branchname> - delete a branch

<p></p>
### Git pull requests
GitHub offers us pull requests (PR) which we can use as a convenient way to request reviews of the work on a feature branch.

A pull request is a request to merge one branch into another branch. Other developers review the PR and suggest changes. If a pull request is approved we can merge the feature branch into the main branch.
